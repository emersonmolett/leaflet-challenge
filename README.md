<p>In this assignment, we visually examine earthquake data. The data is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data source used contains all earthquakes for the past seven days. This assignment used Leaflet, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>Data markers are used to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. </p>

<p>Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, while earthquakes with greater depth appear in a darker color. </p>
