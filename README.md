In this assignment, we visually examine earthquake data. The data is provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data source used contains all earthquakes for the past seven days. This particular data set was pulled 05/15/2021.

Data markers are used to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Per the USGA, magnitude is a measure of the size of the earthquake at its source. Also, the depth can be thougth of as wehre the earthquake begins to rupture. Per the USGS, depth of the event is measured in kilometers. 

Eathquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, while earthquakes with greater depth appear in a darker color.
